    <h2>The Banking Credit Cycle</h2>
    <p>When gold and silver money was deposited into the bank an equivalent amount of deposit bills was issued to the depositor. But Additional bills issued for granting credit has not been not backed by gold, but rather by a debt contract. A debt contract is a promise to pay back with accumulated interests over time. This banking system has 3 important implications:
        Deposit bills are not a money product. Because bills are not fully backed by money products they are excluded from the old 'best trader strategy' of trading leftovers for money products as for example gold.
        Banking credit makes impossible to pay back the debt. Indeed, the debt contract says every year an interest is to be added on the previous-year debt-balance. In other words the debt-balance multiplies itself every year by (1+i) where i is the interest rate. But the number of deposit bills circulating stays the same, it does not increase or multiply. Therefore after some years the total debt balances of outstanding credits overcome the total existing bills making it forever unfeasible to payback the credit debt owed to the banks because there is not enough circulating bills to pay that amount. Clever trick of the banking strategy.
        Banks hide their strategy alternating periods of inflation, Crisis, deflation and reflation. 
        Inflation: Monetary inflation (when circulating bills are increasing because of credit granting) spurs speculation and price inflation (when product prices rise). When price inflation appears banks rise interest rates to earn more and to discourage businessmen to take credits. 
        Crisis: At a higher interest rate speculation withdraws from markets and prices tumble, causing a Crisis (when prices fall over 50% in less than 3 years). Crisis caused by monetary deflation (when circulating bills are diminishing because of credit redemption) and come along price deflation (when product prices falling) or price disinflation (when product prices increase at a slower pace). 
        Deflation: As long as there is not a corresponding monetary reflation (when circulating bills re-increase after having diminished because of banks promoting credit by lowering interest rates) to prevent price deflation the circulating bills drain to the banks allowing them to buy assets at a deflated (Crisis) price. 
        Reflation: Finally the government or some very big institutions collaborating take big credits to reflate the quantity of circulating bills, the prices follow and the economic activity.
        This is why Crises happen: bankers distracting people through credit-pumped euphoric speculative bubbles and panicking Crises: the Banking Credit Cycle.
        To sustain this system preventing people from withdrawing their gold, bankers cartelized under a powerful Federal (central) bank that guards all the gold of banks and issues the US dollar bill. Then they financed the growing political campaigns to lobby policies like:
        Confiscating real money products, like gold, fining those who hoard it (1933 - Executive Order 6102)
        Making taxes payable only in Federal deposit bills. 
        Promote wars as they are a common strategy to increase government debt before, during and after to rebuild countries.
        The last policy worked wonders after World War II as countries agreed that the US dollars was 'as good as gold' to back other currencies and for international transactions. That has allowed american banks to lend money to countries that then deposit back the money in US bank. Allowing the bank to lend that amount many times. 
        Finally in 1971 the convertibility of the US dollar bill into gold was obviously suspended. The POTUS of the day said due to excessive inflation and gold withdrawals, but clearly it was due to excessive credit granting from 1921 to 1927 and from 1942 to 1971.</p>

    <h2>Crisis 2000-2008</h2>
    <p>For example, in 2000 and in 2008 we have two perfect Banking Credit Cycles. After the 60's agricultural revolution and 70'S inflation came a 20 years period of stability where productivity was steadily increasing thanks to the use of computer archives instead of paper archives.
        In 1998 spiking oil prices alerted bankers of coming inflation and interest rates hikes were discouraging people from taking credit. But the 'dot com' bubble was already under way: stock market prices (NASDAQ 100 Index) that had doubled in the previous 2 years doubled twice more from 562pts in 1996, to 1200pts in 1998 and 4800pts in 2000 when the crisis started after 2 years of higher interest rates. People was being irrational buying excessively because of the new millenia and Internet revolution. In the next 3 years till 2003 the index fell back under 900pts level. Can you imagine the euphoria while your savings multiply by 8 in 5 years and the subsequent panic when you lose 80% in 2 years? That's how bankers distract the public to their advantage: they only know when bills are being drained out of or poured in circulation, but they play with news to trick uninformed players. The lemma of the central banks could well be "Distracting people since 1913" because distracting us is the only way to profit from us.
        From 2001 to 2004 banks encouraged credit through low (1%) interest rates and government-sponsored mortgages. These policies straigthened the economy and caused an all time high in oil in 2004, a sign of inflation. Since 2004 interest rates rose from 1% to 4.25% but the real estate bubble was already under way. Speculators kept increasing their projects and consumers kept refinancing their mortgages to consume more. In 2006, again after 2 years of rising interest rates, house prices topped and started to fall. And 2 years later an avanlache of credit defaults almost wiped out the whole banking system. 
        In order to save the banking system, that had in 2008 a monetary monopoly, governments paid for the rescue of banks, the central bankers lowered the interest rate to 0.05% for 6 years and aware it was not enough they started printing bills and buying government debt directly in the market from 2009 to 2016. By buying government debt directly in the market central bankers changed the strategy, they bypassed the need of a credit taker. Usually a big institution like the government is the credit taker, but this time it was not enough. So bankers immediately increased the amount of bills into circulation without increasing the existing debt balance by buying government debt bonds. However when the debt bonds will expire, debt ought to be repaid to the central bank and money be again drained out of the circulation.
        Indeed only 3% of the banking accounts money exists in bills. The rest is just numbers on computers, credits. If ever only 3% of the money was withdrawn then banks would have to close, the way they did in Greece in 2011 and allow only small (~$100/day) withdrawals. </p>

      <h2>Hello Tumbling 20's</h2>
      <p>The Tumbling 20's is an expression coined to refer to the 2020's Crisis. Indeed there are many clues that signal a crisis will hit the economy soon.
          Since 2016 the interest rates have been rising, the overnight rates is gone from 0.00-0.05 to 2.40%
          //fed funds chart
          Even though the interest rates and so the financial cost of companies was rising the stock market still got to almost double between 2016 and 2019.
          //stock market chart
          Trump tax cut artificially swell the corporate net income after tax making it look stable since 2013, but the reality is that corporate net income before taxes have been plunging since 2014 to levels below those of 2008.In short, in 2019 we have lower operating profits than in 2008 and prices are roughly double those of 2008.
          //net income after and before tax, side by side trump tax cut indicated and trend sideways and falling 
          Another alarming fact is that long-term ineterest-rates are much lower than the overnight rate, that is a sign that investors prefer 10 years of fixed income at 1.6% than renovating short term debts at currently 2.4%. Why? Because they believe there is going to be a major crash and the bankers will be forced to lower interest rates to minimum. Therefore, being an investor it is more prudent to take a long term debt at a lower interest as short-term debts will probably be renewed at a very low interest when the Crisis hits. Note that statistically it is more likely that one will default on a 30 years loan than on a 3 month loan, so under normal circumstances investors prefer renovating short-term debts at a lower interest than taking long-term ones.
          There are more factors calling for a crisis:
          Demographically in US, Europe and Japan baby boomers are getting to the age of retirement, so they will be putting a selling pressure on the stock market for the next years.

          Technologically blockchain has made its appearance in 2008 with bitcoin that is 10 years old and Ether, the second blockchain by market capitalization that is 5 years old. Originally Blockchain is an open-source technology that supports any collaboration application, to quote 2 examples among the many: money accounting (what banks do) or collective decision-making (in governments, corporations or organizations...etc). 
          Public Blockchains are an algorithm that
          runs on any computer that becomes a node of the network 
          makes all computers communicate and collaborate with each other through cryptography and game theory, two branches of mathematics
          listens and executes the orders of users the way institutions do, with the exception that it cannot be secretly corrupted
          Indeed most corruption sprouts out of financial favors to politicians or mean people threatening the family of decision-makers. Blockchain cannot conspire against the people as it is developed by all and all instructions executed within a public Blockchain are open-source (publicly available).<br><br>
