    Introduction to
    <span style="text-decoration:line-through;">blockchain</span> Bitcoin and
    Ethereum
  </h2>
  <p>
    Blockchain is the structure of the next generation of internet. But
    blockchain has been popularized through Bitcoin, therefore it is more
    accurate to introduce you to Bitcoin first and then to blockchain.
    Technically Bitcoin is the result of almost 40 years of research in the
    field of cryptography, theory of games and
    <!-- economics. The following diagram shows a more holistic view on Blockchain
    domains.

    Cryptography is the art and science of keeping messages secure. Blockchain
    uses cryptography to sign and authenticate (verify the identity of the
    sender of) messages, store accounts and process transactions publicly but
    preserving privacy. More on this in the technical report.<br /><br />
    Theory of games is concerned with the strategic interaction of individuals
    in a 'game'. A 'game' is defined as a situation containing a set of rules
    and outcomes. For blockchain, theory of games ensures a system design in
    which the best strategy for all individuals is to collaborate honestly.<br /><br />
    Finally economics is the art and science of how to satisfy needs, specially
    collaborating. Economics shows us the banking system is biased toward a
    small elite of bankers and their network of credit-takers (businessmen,
    governments, anyone striving to keep up with advertisement-induced
    consumerism...). Beyond priviledged access to unpayable credit and banking
    currency is constantly devaluated to keep prices increasing and pay off the
    debt more easily . <br /><br />
    Bankers count with a privilege of being able to spy on everyone else bank
    account, and also to forecast in advance (or deliberately cause) Crises and
    booms. For anyone not belonging to this small network of bankers, banking is
    unsustainable and suboptimal as it enslave everyone around an unpayable debt
    and drains wealth from everyone towards bankers and their collaborators
    (politicians, sponsored academicians, international organizations leaders,
    CEOs...).
    <br /><br />
    In effect, how is it possible that having so many abundance prices keep
    increase every year? Because bankers grow banking currency even faster than
    production in order to devaluate the currency they owe to all their
    depositors. Elemental, dear reader.
    <br /><br />
    On the other side Bitcoin is born transparent, compatible with individual
    freedom as it does not require to confiscate gold to be able to service
    people, not even force taxes to be paid in Bitcoins. Bitcoin will work not
    because it has an intrinsic value as money product like gold, it will work
    because it is the most transparent, optimal and sustainable manner to
    transfer money instantly around the globe, and it can be done with a credit
    cards or the phone, objects we already use today. Ask your banker to
    transfer more than $3000 and you'll realize how bureaucratic, idle, deeply
    suboptimal and definitely unsustainable banking is compared to Bitcoin.
    Obsolete.<br /><br />

  <h2>Autumn 2019: Price Skyrocketing</h2>
  <p>
    Looking forward since summer 2019, cryptocurrencies (blockchain units of
    account) future looks garish.<br /><br />
    In spring-summer 2020 the bitcoin reward will halve. The reward halving
    implies Bitcoin inflation will halve. Rewards are the only new bitcoins
    created, more on this in the technical paper. The markets will receive less
    supply from miners cashing their reward, recalling everyone that there will
    only be 21 million Bitcoins consequently pulling the price upwards.
    <br /><br />
    Also Ethereum, the 2nd largest public blockchain by capitalization is going
    to shift from POW (Proof-Of-Work) to POS (Proof-Of-Stake) in the next 3
    years. This shift has several impactful implications: <br /><br />
    Ethereum blockchain will be much more scalable and efficient. Indeed under
    POW the work of the network is replicated on every node, and that
    excessively consumes energy. Under POS the Ethereum blockchain will be split
    into 1084 sub-blockchains called shards and validators will be randomly
    assigned to one of the 1084 shards (partitions of the blockchain) minutes
    before having to generate a collation (a 'shard block') and only some
    witness validator nodes will verify the collation. <br /><br />
    Second, at least 16384 x 32 ETH (more than 500K ETH out of 100 Million ETH)
    must be withdrawn from circulation and put into deposit. New validators
    nodes must burn 32 ETH in order to deposit 32 ETH2 in the Beacon chain, a
    parallell chain managed by a smart contract responsible for the random
    assignment of validator nodes to each shard. Long story short, many ethers
    will be withdrawn from circulation, reducing supply and even putting buying
    pressure on the market as new investors attracted by the ~11% yield on
    validator nodes will be buying 32 Ethers to create a validator node. More on
    this in the technical report.<br /><br />
    On the other side, since September 2019 the US central bank has already had
    to lower interest rates from 2.25-2.5% to 2-2.25% and to pump $53 billion in
    order to keep intertbank interest rate in its target range. The fed funds
    rate climbed to 2.29% out of the 2-2.25% forcing the fed to pour money into
    the market. Indeed investors prefer 1.7% for 2 years than 2.29% overnight
    because they predict a sudden fall of interest rates due to a crash. A crash
    would force a great monetary inflation devaluating the dollar. In the face of
    inflation investors will be dumping their low interest bonds unless interest
    rates climb to competitive levels, but that can only be achieved through
    war. More on this below. In short, last time the fed lowered interest rates
    and poured money directly into the markets there was no alternative monetary
    system. But this time Bitcoin is already 10 years old, Ethereum is 5 years
    old and they represent great alternatives to the tumbling bank's fiat
    currency.

  <h2>On Competition And Principles Of Bitcoin And Ethereum</h2>
  <p>
    Also Facebook, the company that owns facebook, whatsapp and instagram, has
    announced that they, along with tens of partners, will be putting each $10
    million in a fund as collateral in order to back their cryptocurrency to be
    released in 2020: the libra cryptocurrency. The libra cryptocurrency will
    probably see increased adoption as people will easily use it from the
    aforementioned apps, facebook, whatsapp and instagram, which are already
    downloaded and installed in many phones. For example people will finally be
    able to buy and sell things in instagram or through whatsapp. This
    functionality will only bring more curious people to explore the blockchain
    realm. <br /><br />
    However, this crypto is different than public blockchain cryptos like
    Bitcoin and Ethereum. Public blockchains are made by people that wants avoid
    governance, which is the action of a governing state. Public blockchains
    purpose is optimal and minimal cost of collaboration. To make their currency
    succeed, communities like Bitcoin and Ethereum look for innovative ways to
    make their monetary system secure, inclusive for new comers, and scalable
    for millions of transactions every second. On the other hand Facebook is a
    profit corporation and as all corporations their purpose is to maximize
    profits for stockholders. Facebook is designed to catch your attention as
    much time as possible because ultimately Facebook earns money on the ads
    they show to users.<br /><br />
    Furthermore Facebook has betrayed users selling data to mass propaganda
    companies like Cambridge Analytica and spying on users on behalf of the US
    government CIA. Inevitably Facebook would be obliged to collaborate again
    provided some urgent excuse like terrorism and war. But that is just too
    dangerous because to mantain their Banking Hack bankers have an incentive to
    spy on us. Original blockchains, Bitcoin and Ethereum, have been developed
    by intellectual warriors that are fed up of governments submission to
    monetary domination. So they designed the system bottom-up grounded on sound
    principles of freedoms and universal privacy. In public blockchains like
    Bitcoin the data is publicly available, but encrypted in such a way it's
    hard to find the identity of an account holder and it is possible to hide
    one's identity definitively, which is closer to reality of cash
    transactions.<br /><br />
    I pointed here to Facebook's Libra but the reasoning for any other private
    or national cryptocurrency is the same, including Ripple and China
    Cryptocurrency. If these people wanted to have a cryptocurrency founded on
    freedom and privacy they would contribute to bitcoin and Ethereum which are
    communities that already have acquired this fair culture. But the prospects
    of controlling currency are just a too attractive opportunity to let it
    pass.

  <h2>The Tumbling 20's Monetary War</h2>
  <p>
      The only way to save the planet, is to make that everything is concerns everybody. 
    On the short term we said we expect a Tumbling 20's crash and a subsequent tumbling
    interest rates to reach reflation with credit. However low interest rates
    cannot last because ethereum validator nodes earn ~11%. There's a rule of
    thumb in financial markets strategy: smart money moves where interest rates
    are higher. If US, Japan and Europe interest rates stay at current level, that is below 2%, long enough
    smart money will withdraw from banks and place their money in higher interest earning alternatives that did not exist at the time of the last crisis like Ethereum
    validator nodes. <br /><br />
    So on the long term central bankers will have to face a dilemma, low
    interest rates to stimulate the economy or high interest rates to attract
    money. Most likely, low interest rates will not be enough so they will pour
    money into the financial markets buying government bonds. Like last time poured money won't go stay in move to the
    blockchain investments because the yield is higher there. As central bankers
    understand what is happening they will have to raise interest rates sharply
    in the attempt to bring back smart money to banks and keep buying bonds in
    the market to sustain the quantity of money otherwise tumbling due to
    everybody redeeming their debt due to high interest rates. <br /><br />
    The Tumbling 20's Crisis will be very chaotic. Imagine us, our parents, or
    our grandparents losing most of their savings that were invested in
    financial markets. Imagine them going to the bank and crying at the
    kilometric queue there is to withdraw their life savings, and after an
    eternal idle wait withdraw nothing but 100$ because there are no more bills.
    Imagine yourself watching how angry demonstrators don't know how to
    communicate their feeling of loss, how brain-less policemen beat every
    person on the way because chaos has gone out of control and how politicians
    will be meeting to 'solve' the Crisis. <br /><br />
    Governments will keep complying with banks until really independent thinkers
    that know the origin of system flaws, like Ron Paul and John Mcfee , reach
    the political sphere. So likely governments will tax cryptos and take
    bank-favoring policies in the years to come, and these are the most
    frightening. <br /><br />
    The banks, and their under cover network of think tanks, NGOs or even
    governmental departments, will create the screenplay needed for any
    demagogic and tyrannical government decision to be taken. What will be the
    prejudices and false claims leveraged by governments to take the decisions
    that favor banks? <br /><br />
    One thing we are sure is that banks will need a big credit taker to reflate
    the quantity of money, specially once interest rates rise. Still finding
    debtors at a high interest rate is not easy. A major reason must be put
    forward for the debtor to take such a risky debt and assuredly the debt
    balance will never be paid off without a high inflation devaluating currency
    first. For the state to take a debt a major reason must be put forward:
    national terrorism and/or military international intervention. With Trump
    having heavily spoken about North Korea, Iran and Venezuela it is likely
    that one of these countries, will be the target. <br /><br />
    Personally I place my bets on Iran because they are the main financiers,
    along with Syria that has been greatly weakened since 2011, of Hezbollah, a
    moderate Muslim milicia that greatly protected Lebanon against Israel in
    summer 2006.<br /><br />
    Also historically US has had impeccable relations with Israel, and recently
    some premonitory news are paving the way for another Middle East war: 2
    Israelites drones would have been chased in Lebanese soil and Hezbollah
    would have responded targetting a military car in Israelite ground. Whether
    these news are real or planned by bankers to trigger a war is up to the
    reader's judgement and understanding of each character of the screenplay. In
    any way "National security" spending and military spending is indispensable
    to justify government debt at a high interest.<br /><br />
    Notice that North Korea has also been heavily mentioned but that it would be
    a total noob failure from Trump to try making an war amid Japan, China and
    Russia just to save the banking system. Specially after more than 35 years
    of wars in the Middle East weakening countries: not only making war
    interventions to nearby countries like Lebanon, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq,
    Syria and Iran, but also making war intervention to distant countries like
    Yemen and Somalia, two strategic countries that surround the gulf of Aden,
    which the door of the Red Sea towards the Indian Ocean, a necessary passage
    to use the Suez Canal, a key passage for worldwide maritime logistics. Also
    the US favored rebels during the Arab spring in Bahrain, Egypt, Libya,
    Tunissia, Syria and Yemen. <br /><br />
    There is one more reason to target Iran and Venezuela: oil. These two
    countries have the cheapest gasoline in the world thanks to their oil
    reserves. Their production of oil barrels together isn't a third of the US
    production but their reserves are more than 10 times the US reserves. So
    evedently US is targetting the weak countries of the top 5 countries by oil
    reserves. By the way, Cyprus, Israel, Gaza, Lebanon and Syria also share an
    almost virgin reserve of oil discovered in 2010, one year before starting
    Syrian war. <br /><br />
    To sum up, these are only some ideas, and even though there isn't much more
    in politicians' , bankers' and businessmen's heads something different could
    happen. But remember, low interest will probably not be enough to stop the
    Tumbling 20's Crisis, injecting liquidity in the debt markets will pump
    bubbles, most likely gold and silver and cryptocurrencies, which are the
    major substitute to fiat banking currencies like the US dollar. Governments
    will either rebel against banks or comply with their financiers. If they
    comply, which is like going down the rabbit hole, they will fight
    cryptocurrencies by all means. Press releases linking these to drugs, arms
    and prostitution. Even creating terrorism and linking cryptos to it in order
    to make people feel hurt. Then they will likely accuse Venezuela or Iran for
    the terrorism and Trump will launch the army to war. War will allows bankers
    to rise interest rates and put more money into circulation by buying more
    bonds. <br /><br />
    To close I would like to say that all this could be changed by blockchain
    smart contracts. Blockchain applies cybernetics, the science of
    communications and automatic control systems in both machines and living
    things, in order to limit governance, replacing politics and delegation of
    power and trust with an algorithm that is ungoverned and thus incorruptible.
    Decisions and monetary spendings could be voluntary and specific instead of
    obliged and general-purpose-that-ends-up-being-war. Some say it wouldn't
    work because no one would give money for anything. But that is a
    old-fashioned trap. Communication has dramatically changed how people behave
    and perceive themselves inside a environment. And I believe there's an
    awakening going on, people is not anymore working to maximise corporation
    profits. Rather they create public things like Linux, Python or Ethereum to
    maximise productivity. Never these great tools would exist if their creators
    were only worried about maximising present profit. In the contrary, the
    technologies would have stayed institutional proprietary and never
    programmers around the world would have learned and contributed to their
    code and security. There's an undergoing trend about the higher quality of
    tools that are openly built by anyone wanting to contribute freely and learn
    compared to tools built by institutional wage-earning employees to maximise
    corporation profits.<br /><br />
