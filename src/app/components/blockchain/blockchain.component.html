    <h2>Introduction to blockchain</h2>
    <p>Blockchain is the structure of the next generation of internet. Technically blockchain is the result of almost 40 years of research in the field of cryptography, theory of games and economics. The following diagram shows a more holistic view on Blockchain uses. <br><br>

        Cryptography is the art and science of keeping messages secure. Blockchain uses cryptography to sign and authenticate (verify the identity of) messages, store accounts and process transactions publicly but anonymously for privacy.<br><br>
        Theory of games is concerned with the strategic interaction of individuals in a 'game'. A 'game' is a situation containing a set of rules and outcomes. For blockchain, theory of games ensures a system design in which the best strategy for all individuals is to collaborate honestly.<br><br>
        Finally economics is the art and science of how to satisfy needs, specially collaborating. This could be applied to animals, but humans are just more fancy and interesting. Economics shows us the banking system is biased toward a small elite of bankers and their network of credit takers (businessmen, governments, anyone striving to keep up with consumerism...). Among these people, bankers enjoy priviledged access to credit and debtors repay their debt only after the currency has devaluated. <br><br>
        Bankers count with a privilege of being able to spy on everyone else bank account, and also to forecast in advance (or deliberately cause) Crises and booms. For anyone not belonging to this small network of bankers, banking is unsustainable and suboptimal as it enslave everyone around an unpayable debt and drains wealth from everyone towards bankers and their collaborators (politicians, academics, international organizations leaders, CEOs...). <br><br>
        On the other side blockchain is transparent, it is compatible with individual freedom as it does not require to confiscate gold to be able to service people, not even force taxes to be paid in blockchain units. Blockchain will work not because it has an intrinsic value like gold, it will work because it is the most transparent, optimal and sustainable manner to transfer money instantly and distantly, and it can be done with a credit cards or the phone, objects we already use today.<br><br></p>

    <h2>Short-term price movement</h2>
    <p>Looking forward since summer 2019, cryptocurrencies (blockchain units of account) future looks garish.<br><br>
        In spring-summer 2020 the bitcoin reward will halve. The reward halving implies inflation will halve. The markets will receive less supply from miners cashing their reward, pulling the price upwards and recalling everyone that there will only be 21 million Bitcoins. <br><br>
        Also Ethereum, the 2nd largest blockchain by capitalization is going to shift from POW (Proof-Of-Work) to POS (Proof-Of-Stake) in the next 3 years. This shift has several implications: <br><br>
        Ethereum blockchain will be much more scalable and efficient. Indeed under POW the work of the network is replicated on every miner node, and that excessively consumes energy. Under POS the Ethereum blockchain will be split into 1084 sub-blockchains called shards and validators will be randomly assigned to one of the 1084 shards (partitions of the blockchain) minutes before having to generate a collation (a 'shard block') and only some witness validators will verify the collation. <br><br>
        Second, at least 16384 validators nodes must burn 32 ETH in order to have 32 ETH2. ETH2 are ethers of the Beacon chain, a parallell chain managed by a smart contract that will become the base for assigning validator nodes to each shard under the new protocol.<br><br>
        Also Facebook, the company that owns facebook, whatsapp and instagram, has announced that they, along with tens of partners putting each $10 million in a fund as collateral, will release their cryptocurrency in 2020: the libra cryptocurrency. The libra crypto will probably see increased adoption as people will be able to use it natively from the aforementioned apps. For example people will finally be able to buy and sell things in instagram or through whatsapp. This functionality will only bring curious people to explore the blockchain realm.   <br><br>
        However, this crypto is different than public blockchain cryptos like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Public blockchains are made by people that wants avoid governance, which is the action of a governing state. To make their currency succeed these people scratch their head looking for innovative ways to make the system secure for the ones who use it but at the same time open and inclusive for new comers, and all that scalable for almost 8 billion humans making millions of transactions every second. On the other hand Facebook is a corporation and as all corporations their purpose is to maximize profits for stockholders. <br><br>
        Furthermore Facebook has collaborated with the US government to collect information and would be obliged to do it again provided some urgent excuse like terrorism and war. Other blockchains have been developed by all people so governments cannot address any entity to beg data. In public blockchains the data is publicly available, but encrypted in such a way it's hard to find the identity of an account holder and it is possible to hide one's identity definitively, which is closer to reality of cash transactions.<br><br> </p>

      <h2>Long term take over due to interest rate earning amid dishonest war</h2>
      <p>On the short term we said we expect a T20's Crisis and a subsequent tumbling interest rates to reach reflation with credit. However low interest rates cannot last because ethereum validator nodes earn ~11%. There's a rule of thumb in financial markets strategy: smart money moves where interest rates are higher. If US, Japan and Europe interest rates stay low long enough smart money will withdraw from banks and place their money in Ethereum validator nodes. <br><br>
          So on the long term central bankers will have to face a dilemma, lower interest rates to stimulate the economy or higher interest rates to attract money. Most likely, low interest rates will not be enough so they will pour money into the buying government bonds and that money will move to the blockchain investments because the yield is higher there. As central bankers understand what is happening they will have to raise interest rates sharply in the attempt to bring back smart money to banks and keep buying bonds in the market to sustain the quantity of money otherwise tumbling due to everybody redeeming their debt due to high interest rates. <br><br>
          The Tumbling 20's Crisis will be very chaotic. Imagine us, our parents, or our grandparents losing most of their savings that were invested in financial markets. Imagine them going to the bank and crying at the kilometric queue there is to withdraw their life savings, and after an eternal idle wait withdraw nothing but 100$ because there are no more bills. Imagine yourself watching how angry demonstrators don't know how to communicate their feeling of loss, how brain-less policemen beat every person on the way because chaos has gone out of control and how politicians will be meeting to 'solve' the Crisis. <br><br>
          Governments will keep complying with banks until really independent thinkers that know the origin of system flaws, like Ron Paul and John Mcfee , reach the political sphere. So likely governments will tax cryptos and take bank-favoring policies in the years to come, and these are the most frightening. <br><br>
          The banks, and their under cover network of think tanks, NGOs or even governmental departments, will create the screenplay needed for any demagogic and tyrannical government decision to be taken. What will be the prejudices and false claims leveraged by governments to take the decisions that favor banks? <br><br>
          One thing we are sure is that banks will need a big credit taker to reflate the quantity of money, specially once interest rates rise. Still finding debtors at a high interest rate is not easy. A major reason must be put forward for the debtor to take such a risky debt and assuredly the debt balance will never be paid off without a high inflation devaluating currency first. For the state to take a debt a major reason must be put forward: national terrorism and/or military international intervention. With Trump having heavily spoken about North Korea, Iran and Venezuela it is likely that one of these countries, will be the target. <br><br>
          Personally I place my bets on Iran because they are the main financiers, along with Syria that has been greatly weakened since 2011, of Hezbollah, a moderate Muslim milicia that greatly protected Lebanon against Israel in summer 2006.<br><br>
          Also historically US has had impeccable relations with Israel, and recently some premonitory news are paving the way for another Middle East war: 2 Israelites drones would have been chased in Lebanese soil and Hezbollah would have responded targetting a military car in Israelite ground. Whether these news are real or planned by bankers to trigger a war is up to the reader's judgement and understanding of each character of the screenplay. In any way "National security" spending and military spending is indispensable to justify government debt at a high interest.<br><br>
          Notice that North Korea has also been heavily mentioned but that it would be a total noob failure from Trump to try making an war amid Japan, China and Russia just to save the banking system. Specially after more than 35 years of wars in the Middle East weakening countries: not only making war interventions to nearby countries like Lebanon,  Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria and Iran, but also making war intervention to distant countries like Yemen and Somalia, two strategic countries that surround the gulf of Aden, which the door of the Red Sea towards the Indian Ocean, a necessary passage to use the Suez Canal, a key passage for worldwide maritime logistics. Also the US favored rebels during the Arab spring in Bahrain, Egypt, Libya, Tunissia, Syria and Yemen. <br><br>
          There is one more reason to target Iran and Venezuela: oil. These two countries have the cheapest gasoline in the world thanks to their oil reserves. Their production of oil barrels together isn't a third of the US production but their reserves are more than 10 times the US reserves. So evedently US is targetting the weak countries of the top 5 countries by oil reserves. By the way, Cyprus, Israel, Gaza, Lebanon and Syria also share an almost virgin reserve of oil discovered in 2010, one year before starting Syrian war. <br><br>
          To sum up, these are only some ideas, and even though there isn't much more in politicians' , bankers' and businessmen's heads something different could happen. But remember, low interest will probably not be enough to stop the Tumbling 20's Crisis, injecting liquidity in the debt markets will pump bubbles, most likely gold and silver and cryptocurrencies, which are the major substitute to fiat banking currencies like the US dollar. Governments will either rebel against banks or comply with their financiers. If they comply, which is like going down the rabbit hole, they will fight cryptocurrencies by all means. Press releases linking these to drugs, arms and prostitution. Even creating terrorism and linking cryptos to it in order to make people feel hurt. Then they will likely accuse Venezuela or Iran for the terrorism and Trump will launch the army to war. War will allows bankers to rise interest rates and put more money into circulation by buying more bonds. <br><br>
          To close I would like to say that all this could be changed by blockchain smart contracts. Blockchain applies cybernetics, the science of communications and automatic control systems in both machines and living things, in order to limit governance, replacing politics and delegation of power and trust with an algorithm that is ungoverned and thus incorruptible. Decisions and monetary spendings could be voluntary and specific instead of obliged and general-purpose-that-ends-up-being-war. Some say it wouldn't work because no one would give money for anything. But that is a old-fashioned trap. Communication has dramatically changed how people behave and perceive themselves inside a environment. And I believe there's an awakening going on, people is not anymore working to maximise corporation profits. Rather they create public things like Linux, Python or Ethereum to maximise productivity. Never these great tools would exist if their creators were only worried about maximising present profit. In the contrary, the technologies would have stayed institutional proprietary and never programmers around the world would have learned and contributed to their code and security. There's an undergoing trend about the higher quality of tools that are openly built by anyone wanting to contribute freely and learn compared to tools built by institutional wage-earning employees to maximise corporation profits.<br><br>
